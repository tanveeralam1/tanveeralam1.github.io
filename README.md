# Tanveer Alam

Welcome to My Personal Projects

Here you will find projects I've been working on to learn, and increase my skills in software development.

I have experience in C++ from my courses in Computer Science, and am increasing my knowledge from the ground up to learn full-stack web development.

Converter App is a currency exchange calculator in regards to Bangladesh currency conversion from dollars.
The purpose behind the application is for my parents to see how much currency is equivalent to the dollars they send to relatives.
